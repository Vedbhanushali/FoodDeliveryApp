## custom hooks  

when should build custom hook
why and how  
why ?  
ans - reusability, readibility, separation of concerns, modularity, more testable, more maintainability  
there should be common place where we can place is utility functions  
we create helper/utils/common folder and a file which contains this util/helper  
functions.  
Hooks can also be used.  

## modularity  

we have broken down components into meaningful pieces.

## code spliting  

chunking / code splitting / dynamic bundling / lazy loading  
on demand loading / dynamic import
this all are same concepts.  
we cannot bundler everything into one - we have to create
logical bundles.  

when you are loading your component on demand react tries to 
suspend loading during render.
