# React Folder Structure

React developer recommended structure is by features  
we care creating a src folder where we will create components  

## Config file

we need to have config file which contains all the hardcoded things
so that only one place change is need and it will be reflected in all components where it is used  

## use state variable

React uses one way data binding  
can't use normal javascript variables
